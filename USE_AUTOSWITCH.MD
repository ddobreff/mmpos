### üîÑ How to Use the Rig Config Auto switch Option

The **Auto switch** feature allows you to automatically change rig configurations based on the active coin in your miner profile.  
Before we get to that, let‚Äôs briefly explain what a **Rig Configuration** is.

### üõ†Ô∏è What is a Rig Configuration?

Rig configurations are managed using the ![Rig Config](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/18/maintenance.png) **Rig Config** button. Here's how to use it:

1. Go to **Rigs** ‚Üí Select your rig ‚Üí Click the ![Rig Config](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/18/maintenance.png) **Rig Config** button.
2. You'll see a predefined configuration named **`Default`**. This is automatically created for every rig.
3. You can **rename** the `Default` config by clicking on its name and entering a new one.
4. Enable the desired options (e.g., **Fan Control** is usually enough).
5. Click **Update** to save your changes.

Once updated, the new name will appear in the **dropdown menu** on the left. Select it to begin applying overclocks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Overclocks and Presets

1. With your config selected, set your GPU overclocks.
2. Use the **Presets** (folder icon) button to save your OC settings for future reuse.
3. Click **Save OC Changes** in the bottom left to activate your configuration.

### üîÅ Enabling Auto switch for a Config

Once your config is active:

1. Open the ![Rig Config](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/18/maintenance.png) **Rig Config** panel.
2. Select your config from the dropdown.
3. Go to the **Auto switch** tab.
4. Choose the **coins** this OC settings are optimized for.
5. Click **Update**.

Now, this config will automatically activate when the miner profile is set to one of the selected coins.

### ‚ûï Creating Additional Configs

Want to add another configuration for a different coin?

1. Open ![Rig Config](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/18/maintenance.png) **Rig Config**.
2. Click **Create new config**.
3. Give it a name and enable the options you need (again, **Fan Control** is a common one).
4. Click **Create**.

> üí° **Tip:** If you only need to make small changes to an existing config, you can use the **Duplicate config** button instead of creating a new one from scratch. This copies all settings, saving you time.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The maximum number of allowed configs per rig is **5**. This feature is only available for **paid users**.

Your new config will now appear in the dropdown. When selected, your overclocks will be **reset** ‚Äî this is normal for a new config.

- Set overclocks again based on the new coin or algorithm.
- Save the OC preset with a new name for future use.
- Click **Apply**, then **Save OC Changes and Activate New Config**.

Then:

1. Go to **Auto switch** for this new config.
2. Select the coins it should match.
3. Click **Update**.

### üß™ Putting It to the Test

Now that you have two configs, each linked to different coins:

1. Create two **Miner Profiles**, each assigned to a different coin.
2. Switch between them and observe how the rig automatically switches to the correct configuration.
3. This process happens seamlessly ‚Äî no manual OC changes required.

### ‚ö° Why Use Auto switch?

- Saves time when switching coins.
- Lets you optimize OC per coin or algorithm.
- Combined with **Custom Placeholders**, it's one of the most powerful and flexible setups available.
- Works great with **Multiswitch** to reconfigure your entire farm in seconds.
